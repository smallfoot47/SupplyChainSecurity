# **Software Supply Chain Security**  

This project demonstrates artifact signing, verification, and transparency log integrity validation using Sigstore's **cosign** and **Rekor** tooling.
It serves as the foundation for understanding software supply chain security concepts, such as artifact verification and log consistency proofs.

---

## **Project Description**  

The project achieves the following objectives:  

1. **Signing and Uploading an Artifact**:  
   A simple text file artifact (`artifact.md`) is signed and its signature is uploaded to the public instance of Rekor's transparency log.  

2. **Verifying Entry Inclusion and Artifact Signature**:  
   - Fetch the signed artifact's details from the Rekor log.  
   - Verify the artifact's signature using its certificate and the public key.  
   - Verify the inclusion proof using Rekor's Merkle Tree transparency model.  

3. **Verifying Transparency Log Consistency**:  
   - Fetch older and current checkpoints of Rekor's transparency log.  
   - Verify the consistency of the log between an older checkpoint and the latest checkpoint using a Merkle proof.  

This process ensures transparency, immutability, and the integrity of software supply chains.

## **Dependencies**  

Ensure the following tools and Python libraries are installed:  

### **System Dependencies**  
1. **Sigstore's cosign**:  
   Install following the official guide:  
   [https://docs.sigstore.dev/system_config/installation/](https://docs.sigstore.dev/system_config/installation/)  

   Verify installation:  
   ```bash
   cosign version
   ```

2. **Python**:  
   - Version: 3.8 or later.  

3. **Rekor Public Instance**:  
   [Rekor API](https://rekor.sigstore.dev/)

---

### **Python Package Requirements**  

Install required Python libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:  
```txt
requests
base64
json
cryptography
```

---

## **Installation Instructions**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify `cosign` installation:  
   ```bash
   cosign version
   ```

---

## **Usage Instructions**  

### **1. Sign the Artifact**  

Create an artifact and sign it using `cosign`.  

```bash
cosign sign --yes artifact.md
```

This will:  
- Prompt for identity verification.  
- Generate a signature and upload it to Rekor's transparency log.  

---

### **2. Verify Artifact Inclusion and Signature**  

Run the Python verification script to verify the artifact’s inclusion in the Rekor log:  

```bash
python verify_artifact.py --log-index <logIndex>
```

Where `<logIndex>` is the index returned after signing.

---

### **3. Fetch and Verify Latest Checkpoint**  

Fetch the current Rekor checkpoint and verify its integrity:  

```bash
python verify_artifact.py -c
```

---

### **4. Verify Consistency Between Checkpoints**  

Provide older checkpoint details to verify consistency with the latest checkpoint:  

```bash
python verify_artifact.py --old-tree-id <tree_id> --old-tree-size <tree_size> --old-root-hash <root_hash>
```

---

## **File Structure**  

```
.
├── artifact.md              # The artifact to sign
├── verify_artifact.py       # Main Python script for verification
├── merkle_proof.py          # Merkle proof utility functions
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

---

## **Example Workflow**  

1. **Sign the artifact**:  
   ```bash
   cosign sign --yes artifact.md
   ```

2. **Fetch log entry details**:  
   ```bash
   python verify_artifact.py --log-index <logIndex>
   ```

3. **Verify log inclusion**:  
   Output will display:  
   - Signature validity.  
   - Merkle proof inclusion status.  

4. **Fetch the latest checkpoint**:  
   ```bash
   python verify_artifact.py -c
   ```

5. **Verify consistency between checkpoints**:  
   ```bash
   python verify_artifact.py --old-tree-id <tree_id> --old-tree-size <tree_size> --old-root-hash <root_hash>
   ```

---

## **Project Demo**  

The script performs the following:  
1. Signs an artifact and uploads its signature to Rekor.  
2. Verifies the artifact's inclusion in Rekor's transparency log.  
3. Fetches and validates the latest transparency log checkpoint.  
4. Verifies log consistency between older and newer checkpoints.
